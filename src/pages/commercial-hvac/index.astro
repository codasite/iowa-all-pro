Split systems are connected to a building’s existing ductwork. They also work well for small offices, restaurants, and individual storefronts. Each area comes with its own thermostat or can be controlled through a central system. <br><br>The main issue with these systems? Each space you want controlled needs its own HVAC unit. This clutters your roof or the outside of your building. If excessive, it can turn even the most attractive building into an eyesore.

They arrive fully assembled from the factory. Some RTUs only cool while some units can both heat and cool. <br><br>In terms of limitation, most are based on architecture. These units lose effectiveness if required to heat or cool a building taller than 10 stories. Their structure also requires a flat roof for safe and stable installation.

They rely on heat recovery systems and heat pumps to circulate refrigerant from a central outdoor unit throughout the building. Their segmented setup allows them to transfer heated air to areas that need it while also cooling other areas. The rate at which this refrigerant is distributed determines the temperature of an area. These systems are quiet and take up very little real estate in your building. Their lack of ductwork and compact size also makes them easy to install. When compared to traditional ducted systems, VRFs are 30% more efficient than ductless systems</p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n</div></section>\n    <section data-variationsetnum=\"401\" data-variationnum=\"477\" data-variationorder=\"1\"><div class=\"container\">\n    <h2 class=\"OA-hd-5\">6 Ways Commercial HVAC Differs From Residential HVAC</h2>\n    <p>You might be tempted to call up the first residential HVAC company you find when your RTU or VRF needs service, but we advise against it. Though many companies might provide limited commercial service, they likely lack the expertise needed for large-scale projects. Commercial HVAC needs differ from those of a residential unit for many reasons, including:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li><strong class=\"oaservpgbulletem\">Size:</strong> Commercial units need to ventilate and condition air for a much larger area than residential ones. This means that the components used are larger, heavier, and more difficult to move. Commercial HVAC units often weigh in at a few tons. This requires specialized moving equipment and often a separate set of tools.</li>\n    <li><strong class=\"oaservpgbulletem\">Location:</strong> In houses, the furnace is often located in the basement while the AC unit is relegated to the backyard. This is referred to as splitting the system. Commercial buildings typically house their HVAC units in the basement, in a utility room, or on the roof. The latter poses safety concerns not usually posed by residential HVAC work.</li>\n    <li><strong class=\"oaservpgbulletem\">Economizers:</strong> These might just be <a href=\"https://svach.lbl.gov/what-is-an-economizer/\" target=\"_blank\">commercial HVAC’s secret weapon</a>. Economizers are devices that use sensors and logic controllers to flush out heat and bring in cold air from outside. This <b>lowers overall cooling costs and lowers unit wear and tear</b>. It also increases ventilation and dispels stale air. The latter feature is especially useful to owners of older buildings. Residential HVAC contractors don’t have much experience diagnosing and repairing economizers. This is why it’s best to <b>leave servicing these to a professional</b>. </li>\n    <li><strong class=\"oaservpgbulletem\">Zones:</strong> Unlike your typical residential HVAC system, commercial systems are comprised of <b>a number of packaged units with individual thermostats</b>. This allows one building to support a number of different temperatures. This allows for area-by-area customization. Because they can work on one zone at a time, it also minimizes total comfort interruptions. But the added connections also make service and maintenance more complex.</li>\n    <li><strong class=\"oaservpgbulletem\">Ventilation:</strong> The larger <b>size of commercial buildings make for more complex ventilation</b>. Because there are often fewer windows, mechanical ventilation is often necessary to deal with stale air. Restaurants, fitness centers, and laboratories also require heightened ventilation levels to achieve optimal air quality. Knowing where and when to set up mechanical ventilation is a key part of commercial HVAC service. This is knowledge residential HVAC companies often lack. </li>\n    <span class=\"commercialcost\"><li><strong class=\"oaservpgbulletem\">Cost:</strong> A typical homeowner might invest $10,000 to $15,000 in a new heating and AC system. However, due to the amount of cooling needed to handle all the people in a commercial facility, commercial systems typically are required to handle bigger loads than a residential systems—which can be more costly than replacing a residential system. <b>Protect your comfort investment in Des Moines</b>.
